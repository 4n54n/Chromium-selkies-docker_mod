This project is based on LinuxServer.io’s Chromium container:

It has been adapted to work with Selkies as a remote browser environment.
In this repository, the core Chromium JavaScript/UI files have been modified to present a minimal interface, exposing only the essential controls for uploading and downloading files. All unnecessary menus and options have been removed to provide a clean, lightweight remote browsing experience.
